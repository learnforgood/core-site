      <h1>Learn For Good</h1>
      <h2>Learn. Code. Change the World.</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Learn for Good is a group organized in 2017 to help software creators and would-be creators organize into real-world project teams to build open-source software for use by non-profits and other social-good organizations.</p>

      <h3>Why?</h3>

      <p>
      LFG was created to address several interlocking challenges:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>It's hard to get practical experience in software development if you don't already have a track record of practical experience.</li>
        <li>Many aspects of software development are difficult, expensive, or impossible to learn without a team</li>
        <li>The software industry has historically underutilized the enormous potential of most of the people who want to work in software development and could benefit from doing so.</li>
        <li>Starting and operating organizations targeted at the social good is a fairly cryptic process, often relying on archaic tools, stale information, and out-of-date resources.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
      We have two equally-importants goals. The first is to teach ourselves and anyone willing to learn all aspects of the software development lifecycle through real-world projects, providing practical, documented experience that can be leveraged into employment or used to start our own companies and organizations.  
      </p>

      <h3>Roles</h3>
      <p>LFG is looking for members who have or want to acquire experience in:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Product Ownership</li>
        <li>Project Management</li>
        <li>Technical Writing</li>
        <li>Technical Leadership</li>
        <li>Mentoring</li>
        <li>Software Development</li>
        <li>Software Testing</li>
        <li>Devops &amp; Automation</li>
      </ul> 

      <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
