      <h1>Learn For Good</h1>
      <h2>Learn. Code. Change the World.</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Learn for Good is a group organized in 2017 to help software creators and would-be creators organize into real-world project teams to build open-source software for use by non-profits and other social-good organizations.</p>

      <h3>Why?</h3>

      <p>
      LFG was created to address several interlocking challenges:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>It's hard to get practical experience in software development if you don't already have a track record of practical experience.</li>
        <li>Many aspects of software development are difficult, expensive, or impossible to learn without a team</li>
        <li>The software industry has historically underutilized the enormous potential of most of the people who want to work in software development and could benefit from doing so.</li>
        <li>Starting and operating organizations targeted at the social good is a fairly cryptic process, often relying on archaic tools, stale information, and out-of-date resources.</li>
        <li>It's not easy to break into open-source development</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
      We have two equally-importants goals. The first is to teach ourselves and anyone willing to learn all aspects of the software development lifecycle through real-world projects, providing practical, documented experience that can be leveraged into employment or used to start our own companies and organizations. The second is to make it at least as easy to start an organization or company targeted at changing the world as it is to start one to build software. 
      </p>

      <h3>Roles</h3>
      <p>LFG is looking for members who have or want to acquire experience in:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Product Ownership</li>
        <li>Project Management</li>
        <li>Technical Writing</li>
        <li>Technical Leadership</li>
        <li>Mentoring</li>
        <li>Software Development</li>
        <li>Software Testing</li>
        <li>Devops &amp; Automation</li>
      </ul> 

      <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>

      <p>
      We're working from three guiding principles:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>We should align how we do well with how we do good.</strong> LFG isn't about denying you can do good work for others and benefit yourself at the same time. Both our stated goals are equally important: Helping each other become better software builders and helping social-good organizations do more with the resources they have are important.</li>
        <li><strong>What we build should be free.</strong> As an organization of volunteers, everything we produce should be freely available for use by anyone who has a use for it. All code, documentation, markup, graphics, and other resources created by LFG will be open source and freely licensed.</li>
        <li><strong>This is going to be hard enough of a challenge without us making it harder on each other.</strong> Getting from where are to where we want to be is a lot of work. Real, working software products take thousands of hours to build and rely on thousands of hours of learning by the people who build them. Convincing people to volunteer for the less-fun bits is hard. We ask that everyone involved follow <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wheatons-law">Wheaton's Law</a>.</li>
      </ol>
